Modules:- 

It is a chunk of code, that will be used to maintain modularity of the component/class. 

Modules are implemented by:- 

Export and Import. 

a) Export:- Any declaration (such as a variable, function,class,interface etc) can be exported by adding the export keyword.

   Export statements are handy when exports need to be renamed for consumers.

  e.g.,Stringvalidator.ts--

  export interface StringValidator {
  isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;
  }

b) Import:-mporting is just about as easy as exporting from a module. Importing an exported declaration is done through using one of the import forms.

-> ./ - 1 file back 
-> ../ - 2 files back. 

     ======================================================================== 

Interfaces:- 

It defines the structures of a class/object. 

-maintains the structure, can be used as function types. 

-mainly it is used to define a contract b/w unrelated classes.

-An interface_name is name of interface. 

-Interface body conatins variables and methods declarations. 

Creating an interface OS with properties.

e.g.,interface OS { 
 
     name: String;  

     language: String;  
  }  

  let OperatingSystem = (type: OS): void => {  

  console.log('Android ' + type.name + ' has ' + type.language + ' language.');  
};  

let Oreo = {name: 'O', language: 'Java'} 
 
OperatingSystem(Oreo);  
 
compiling ts file into js- 

let OperatingSystem = (type) => {  

    console.log('Android ' + type.name + ' has ' + type.language + ' language.');  
};  

let Oreo = { name: 'O', language: 'Java' };  

OperatingSystem(Oreo);  

output:--Android O has java language. 

use of interface:-- 

1.validate the specific structure of properties. 

2.Objects passed as parameters. 

3.Objects returned from functions. 


     ========================================================================= 

Tuples:- 

Store a collection of values of varied types.Where arrays will not serve this purpose.

Typescript give us a data type called tuple that helps to achieve such a purpose.

Tuples enable storing multiple fields of different types and can also be passed as parameters to functions. 

Syntax:- 

var tuple_name = [value1,value2,value3,â€¦value n] 

e.g.,var mytuple = [10,"Hello"]; 

Tuple values are individually called items. Tuples are index based.

syntax:- 
  
tuple_name[index] 

e.g,

var mytuple = [10,"Hello"];

console.log(mytuple[0]) 

console.log(mytuple[1])

output:- 10 
         Hello 

      ================================================================ 

Differnece b/w let,var and const..?? 

These are the keywords to declare variables.

Var:- 

Can be used before its declared, its is function scope variables (availiable outside scope).

Values can be changed. 

let:- 

Local scoped variables.Not availiable outside the scope.

values can be changed. 

const:- 

values cannot be changed.

If we give 'obj' then we can manipulate the value.
